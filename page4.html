    <h2> Artist Statement </h2>
      <p class="p-welcome">
        My artistic process begins with finding a concept that inspires and/or challenges me, and building off of that. After solidifying a concrete plan, I then work on how I am going to develop the idea into a physical reality. Given my main focus is on digital media, I begin with working on the layout for any digital processes before diving into the sculptural aspects that are yet to be applied. My strongest skill sets are using Premiere Pro, and Adobe Illustrator.
      As an artist I care about contributing to new relationships between various mediums. I am fascinated by the way sculpture interacts with digital media art. This strong interest developed from an experience I had at an art museum I visited in high school. The exhibit was partnered with teamLAB and carried only digital media based artwork. This visit changed my entire view on art, and art as a career. I knew this was something truly amazing that I wanted to be a part of, and this goal hasn’t changed since. Becoming a digital media artist is my ultimate career goal and I’m ecstatic for that the future holds as my academic career at San Jose State University continues.

        Video Art is a passion of mine, it allows me to work creatively
        and with constant fluidity with my skills and talents. I am growing as an Artist
        everyday, and I continue to work and experiment with new art forms, programs, and
        systems that help me be better at what my end goal is.
        Through Video Art, I can expand on single simple ideas and stretch them enormously to be
        greater and more grand than I expected, especially with working with a team. In the first and second video art
        shown on this page, the viewer experiences collaborative artwork that was brainstormed by three young women including
        myself who worked hard to make a single concept about memories flourish into digital art.
        For the final video, this was my humorous take on my commuter life to SJSU. My everyday schedule consists of (sometimes) dreadful
        hours of driving and moving from class to class. But it is all worth it in the end because I get to move forward with what I love to do,
        Digital Media Art.
